## Photography Collections

My photography is divided into two main areas of focus, each with its own distinct approach while maintaining my documentary, cinematic style. Explore the collections below to view my work.

### The Baykal Media Approach

Regardless of the subject matter, all of my photography is guided by these principles:

- **Documentary Approach** – Capturing authentic moments as they unfold naturally  
- **Cinematic Flair** – Using composition, light, and color to create images with a film-like quality  
- **Emotional Impact** – Creating photographs that evoke feeling and connect with viewers  
- **Meaningful Storytelling** – Using visual elements to tell deeper stories about subjects and scenes

Whether I'm photographing vast landscapes or intimate portraits, these core principles inform my creative process and the final images I deliver.
