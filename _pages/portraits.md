## Portrait Photography

My portrait photography explores the authentic character and genuine emotions of my subjects. Using a documentary approach with cinematic elements, I create portraits that reveal personality, tell stories, and capture meaningful moments.

### My Approach to Portraits

When working with portrait subjects, I focus on:

- **Connection** - Building rapport and trust to capture authentic expressions
- **Environment** - Using meaningful locations that enhance the subject's story
- **Natural moments** - Allowing genuine interactions rather than stiff poses
- **Emotional depth** - Looking for the subtle expressions that reveal character
- **Storytelling** - Creating images that hint at the broader narrative of a person's life

### Portrait Sessions

I offer several types of portrait sessions:

- **Individual Portraits** - Capturing your unique personality and story
- **Family Sessions** - Documenting the connections and dynamics between family members
- **Environmental Portraits** - Photographing people in contexts meaningful to them (workplace, studio, home)
- **Documentary Day-in-the-Life** - Following subjects through their natural routines to capture authentic moments
