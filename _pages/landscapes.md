## Landscape Photography

My landscape photography focuses on capturing the raw beauty and emotional impact of natural environments. From dramatic mountain ranges to serene coastal scenes, I seek to create images that transport viewers and evoke a sense of wonder about our natural world.

### My Approach to Landscapes

When photographing landscapes, I focus on:

- **Light and timing** - Often shooting during golden hour or blue hour for dramatic lighting
- **Composition** - Using leading lines and natural framing to create depth
- **Emotion** - Capturing the mood and feeling of a location, not just its appearance
- **Authenticity** - Representing nature in its true form while highlighting its most compelling aspects

### Collections

My landscape work is divided into several ongoing collections:

- **Mountain Series** - Exploring the majesty and scale of mountain ranges
- **Coastal Dreams** - Documenting the ever-changing relationship between land and sea
- **Forest Stories** - Intimate portraits of woodland environments through changing seasons
- **Desert Minimalism** - Finding beauty in the stark simplicity of desert landscapes
