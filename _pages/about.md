## About Me

Welcome! I'm Cem Baykal, the photographer and storyteller behind Baykal Media. My journey in photography began as a young child and was greatly expedited by my purchase of a film camera my freshman year of college. Starting with a film camera helped me to appreciate each shot I took and helped establish my fundamentatls. I specialize in documentary-style photography with a cinematic approach, capturing authentic moments that tell compelling stories.

## My Approach

I believe that every image should evoke emotion and tell a story. My documentary style is about capturing genuine moments as they unfold, while my cinematic approach adds a dramatic and artistic dimension to each photograph. Whether I'm shooting breathtaking landscapes or intimate portraits, I strive to create images that resonate with viewers on an emotional level.

## Technical Expertise

- Documentary storytelling
- Environmental portraiture
- Landscape photography
- Natural light techniques
- Post-processing for cinematic looks

## Philosophy

Every photograph is an opportunity to preserve a moment, tell a story, and create a connection. I approach each session with curiosity, empathy, and a commitment to authentic representation. My goal is not just to take pictures, but to create visual narratives that help you remember your fondest moments as they unfolded.
