### Frequently Asked Questions

**How far in advance should I book?**  
For portrait sessions, I recommend booking 2-4 weeks in advance. For events or special occasions, 2-3 months is ideal to ensure availability.

**What should I wear for my portrait session?**  
Generally, I recommend wearing clothing that makes you feel confident and comfortable, while avoiding large logos or distracting patterns.

**Do you travel for photography sessions?**  
Depends! I am located in the Raleigh-Durham area. Travel is very dependent on location and timing. Travel fees may apply depending on the location.

**How long until I receive my photos?**  
Portrait sessions are typically delivered within 2 weeks. Larger events or commercial projects may take 3-4 weeks.

**Do you offer rush delivery?**  
Rush delivery is available for an additional fee, depending on my current workload and the size of your project.
